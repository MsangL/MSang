# üéØ About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at INRIA Bordeaux in the team [EDGE](https://edge.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) and under the supervision of [Ayse N. Arslan](https://edge.gitlabpages.inria.fr/team-members/arslan/), [Boris Detienne](https://edge.gitlabpages.inria.fr/team-members/detienne/), and [Aur√©lien Froger](https://edge.gitlabpages.inria.fr/team-members/froger/).

Participant in the [EDF-INRIA Challenge](https://www.inria.fr/fr/inria-edf), titled "Managing the Electrical Systems of Tomorrow, I am interested in analyzing the economic and social viability of innovations in distribution networks, as well as developing load planning tools that enable efficient and equitable energy management. Additionally, I work on long-term investment issues in electrical networks, at the scale of one or more states, to meet projected demand over several years. My research takes into account technical, economic, and environmental constraints while integrating the inherent uncertainty of these challenges.

## üìö Teaching Experiences

I taught the following courses as an adjunct lecturer during my PhD.

### **Operations Research ‚Äì Supplementary**
- **Level**: Master's in Algorithms (Algo), University of Montpellier, 1st Year
- **Instructor**: [Eric Bourreau](https://www.lirmm.fr/eric-bourreau/)
- **Hours**: 36
- **Description**: This course is divided into two parts: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming and Dynamic Programming. The aim of the Linear Programming part is to learn how to model a problem formulated in natural language as a linear program and solve it after implementing it in CPLEX‚Äôs OPL language. The goal of the Dynamic Programming part is to represent and solve optimization problems as sub-problems that are easier to solve.

### **Industrial Operations Research**
- **Level**: Master's in Algorithms (Algo), University of Montpellier, 2nd Year
- **Instructors**: [Eric Bourreau](https://www.lirmm.fr/eric-bourreau/), [Chlo√© Desdouits](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdesdouits)
- **Hours**: 36
- **Description**: This course focuses on operations research from an industrial perspective. The objective is to model, implement, and solve a real-world problem proposed by an industrial partner while adopting best programming practices, particularly in a DevOps approach. Students are introduced to scientific research, including performing literature reviews, analyzing results from their solution approaches, and comparing them to existing methods in the literature.

### **Graphs and Networks**
- **Level**: Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computer Science Applied to Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Montpellier 3, 3rd Year
- **Instructor**: [Sylvain Durand](https://www.lirmm.fr/~sdurand/)
- **Hours**: 31.5
- **Description**: This course teaches students how to represent problems using graphs and solve them by implementing associated algorithms such as shortest path, maximum flow, circuit, minimum spanning tree, etc. The goal is for students to understand the principles and workings of the libraries they will use in their data science courses.

---

### **Modeling and Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Level**: Preparatory Course for Engineering Schools (Polytechnique), 2nd Year
- **Instructor**: [Marianne Huchard](https://marianne-huchard.fr/)
- **Hours**: 33
- **Description**: This course introduces students to UML modeling of a problem described in natural language, followed by object-oriented programming in Java. Students learn object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.
