## ðŸŽ¯ About Me
Postdoctoral Research Position at INRIA Bordeaux, EDGE team.

**Participant in the [EDF-INRIA Challenge](https://www.inria.fr/fr/inria-edf), titled "Managing the Electrical Systems of Tomorrow."**

On one hand, I am interested in analyzing the economic and social viability of innovations in distribution networks, as well as developing load planning tools that enable efficient and equitable energy management. On the other hand, I work on long-term investment issues in electrical networks, at the scale of one or more states, to meet projected demand over several years. These works take into account technical, economic, and environmental constraints, while integrating the inherent uncertainty of these issues.
